        <p>Lancers were arranged. Gabriel found himself partnered with Miss Ivors. She was a frank-mannered talkative young lady, with a freckled face and prominent brown eyes. She did not wear a low-cut bodice and the large brooch which was fixed in the front of her collar bore on it an Irish device and motto.</p>

        <p>Gabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows, as if he did not understand, when she said bluntly:</p>

        <p>"O, innocent Amy! I have found out that you write for The Daily Express. Now, aren't you ashamed of yourself?"</p>

        <p>"Well, I'm ashamed of you," said Miss Ivors frankly. "To say you'd write for a paper like that. I didn't think you were a West Briton."</p>

        <p>When their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and inattentive. Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said in a soft friendly tone:</p>

        <p>When they were together again she spoke of the University question and Gabriel felt more at ease. A friend of hers had shown her his review of Browning's poems. That was how she had found out the secret: but she liked the review immensely. Then she said suddenly:
        "'But I do not. I cannot--I cannot believe--not yet. I cannot believe that I shall never see him again, that nobody will see him again, never, never, never.'</p>

        <p>"'Ah, but I believed in him more than anyone on earth--more than his own mother, more than--himself. He needed me! Me! I would have treasured every sigh, every word, every sign, every glance.'</p>

        <!-- <p>"'Forgive me. I--I--have mourned so long in silence--in silence. . . . You were with him--to the last? I think of his loneliness. Nobody near to understand him as I would have understood. Perhaps no one to hear. . . .'</p>

        <p>"'Repeat them,' she said in a heart-broken tone. 'I want--I want--something--something--to--to live with.'</p>

        <p>"I was on the point of crying at her, 'Don't you hear them?' The dusk was repeating them in a persistent whisper all around us, in a whisper that seemed to swell menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind. 'The horror! The horror!'</p>

        <p>"'His last word--to live with,' she murmured. 'Don't you understand I loved him--I loved him--I loved him!'</p>

        <p>"Hang me if I saw him sitting there, Nattie! I know it's deuced awkward for you. But I hope you'll forgive me this once--this very first break. Why, what's the matter?"</p>

        <p>"Don't touch me; don't come near me," she returned angrily. "What do you mean by entering the house without ringing?"</p>

        <p>"I came in with your brother, as I often do," he answered coldly, in self-justification. "We came in the side way. He went upstairs and I came in here hoping to find you. The explanation is simple enough and ought to satisfy you that the misadventure was unavoidable. But do say that you forgive me, Nathalie," he entreated, softening.</p>

        <p>"Forgive you! You don't know what you are talking about. Let me pass. It depends upon--a good deal whether I ever forgive you."</p>

        <p>At that next reception which she and Brantain had been talking about she approached the young man with a delicious frankness of manner when she saw him there.</p>

        <p>"Will you let me speak to you a moment or two, Mr. Brantain?" she asked with an engaging but perturbed smile. He seemed extremely unhappy; but when she took his arm and walked away with him, seeking a retired corner, a ray of hope mingled with the almost comical misery of his expression. She was apparently very outspoken.</p> -->
